# Creating Documents

## Document Creation

There are four different document types which you can create / upload

- Use the **New Text Document** button to create a new document in Document Manager
- Use the **Upload Document** button to add an external document to Document Manager
    - The Maximum upload size is set by default to 10MB - this can be increased if required on your instance using the following system setting in the admin console - communications.maxfileUploadSize
    - By Default the following file types are not permitted to be uploaded - exe, bat, cmd, js, and vbs. These can be changed and added to on your instance using the following system setting in the admin console - security.fileUploadRestriction.webdav.types
- Use the **New Drawing** button to create a new drawing in Document Manager
- Use the **External Link** button to create a document which opens an external link from a document in Document Manager (N.B. this option only links to the document and there is no integration with the document repository. For example, permissions need to be managed separately).
    - Add the external link
    - Add a title / description for the document
    - As with any other type of document, users will be able to search for the external link document by it's title / description and any tags it has been given
