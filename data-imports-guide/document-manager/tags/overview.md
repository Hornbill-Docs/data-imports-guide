# Overview

## Introduction

Tags are labels that can be added to various parts of Hornbill that facilitate browsing and searching to make things easier to find. Currently Tags are only available in Document Manager for documents but will be used more widely in the future.

Use the Global Search facility at the top of your screen and select Tags from the drop down list to search for the docs you need.
