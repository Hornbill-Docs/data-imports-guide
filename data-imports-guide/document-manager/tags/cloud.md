# Tag Cloud

## Introduction
On the installation of Document Manager a number of default roles are included.

All users of the Hornbill Platform, regardless of the application, must possess the *Collaboration Role*. To use, and interact with, the Hornbill Document Manager app, a user must also be allocated one of the app-specific roles listed below. If the need arises, it is possible to create custom roles to suit a specific requirement.

## Document Library Users

Visualize the tags in a Tag Cloud, click through on any tag to see the documents which have been tagged with specific tags.

Users with the **Docmanager Library User** role will be able to add new tags from this view.
Switch the language to display the Tag cloud in the languages enabled on your instance

- If different language versions of the tag have not been defined under Tag Management then the tags will be displayed in the default language
