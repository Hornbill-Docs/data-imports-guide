# Contacts

## Introduction

Any individual that belongs to an external organisation who you wish to interact with during the delivery of a service will be stored in Hornbill as Contact records. Contact records would typically be associated to an Organisation record. Contacts can be configured to use the Customer Portal for profile management and use of application features designed to allow for communication between you and your contacts.

To manage contact records, a user must possess one of the following security roles:

- Admin Role
- Contacts Admin

#### **Manage Contacts**

From a contact's record the following options are available to you

- **Mark as Private** - mark a contact as only being visible to you
