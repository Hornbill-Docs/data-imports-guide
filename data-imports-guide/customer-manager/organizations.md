# Organizations

## Introduction

If you deliver a service to organizations external to your own, you will store them in Hornbill as Organization records. They work in conjunction with contact records which can be associated to Organization records. Organization records can also be used to represent suppliers, or third parties. They operate externally to Hornbill so canâ€™t collaborate but can request a service from you as a customer. Customer Manager allows organizations to be better managed so that you can improve the relationship you have with your customers.
