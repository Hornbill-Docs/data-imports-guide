# Running an Import

Ultimately, the executable will be scheduled in the Windows task scheduler (see later) but to test, gain confidence, and perform an initial upload of asset relationship records into Service Manager, the utility can be executed from a command prompt window on an ad-hoc basis. The command used to execute the import can contain several command line arguments.

## Command Line Arguments
- `file` - Defaults to `conf.json` - Name of the Configuration file to load.
- `dryrun` - Defaults to `false` - Set to true and the XMLMC for the creation and update of assets will not be called, and instead the generated XML for each asset will be dumped to the log file. This is to aid in debugging the initial connection information.
- `creds` - Defaults to `false` - Set to true to return the API key that is stored in your import configuration. See NOTE in First Run, below. As well as user & computer specific access, you will also be prompted to input the ID of the instance that the API key was generated on.
- `version` - Defaults to `false` - Set to true to return the version number of the tool, then exit

## First Run

From version **2.0.0** of this utility, when you first run the utility it will prompt you for two vital pieces of information
- The Instance ID (also reffered to as the instance name) of your Hornbill instance (case-sensitive)
    - https://live.hornbill.com/`instanceid` (case sensitive).
- The [API key](https://docs-internal.hornbill.com/data-imports-guide/assets/authentication#api-keys) (also case-sensitive) This needs to be created against a Hornbill user account with enough rights to create and update asset records in Service Manager. Details on how to create an API key can be found in the [Hornbill Platform Fundamentals](https://docs-internal.hornbill.com/esp-fundamentals/security/api-keys) book.

:::important
The encrypted instance ID and API key can only be decrypted on the computer (physical or virtual) that the encryption was performed on, and by the user, that performed the encryption, so please keep this in mind when scheduling your imports.
:::

Should you wish to use a different API key to what has been previously encrypted, just delete the **import.cfg** file from the folder where the import binary resides, and re-run your import from the command line inputting the Instance ID and new API Key as you would have on its first run.

## Testing Overview

There is no substitute for hands-on experience when becoming familiar with the Hornbill import utilities. The Asset Relationship Import utility accepts and understands a number of [command line arguments](https://docs-internal.hornbill.com/data-imports-guide/assets/asset-relationship-command#command-line-arguments) that can be used when running the utility from the Windows command line or PowerShell.

:::tip
The most important argument when testing is -dryrun=true . When this is provided, no record create or update reuests will be sent to Hornbill. Instead, all create or update requests that would have been made into Hornbill are output to a log file, including input parameters, which provides you with an opportunity to review their content and understand any error messages that may occur.

Below are some high level steps to help you build confidence in your configuration:
1. In the configuration, write your query accordingly to target a single or small set of asset records. Itâ€™s good practice to initially test against a single, or small set of, asset objects, as this allows the dryrun to complete quicker and there is less log content to review.
2. Perform a dryrun (by executing the utility along with the `-dryrun=true` command line parameter) - this allows you to confirm that the configuration is correct and that a connection to the source database can be established, without importing any asset data into your Hornbill instance.
3. Review the commind line output and log file for any errors or warnings, and where necessary check and rectify any errors against the Common Error Messages listed in the [Troubleshooting](/data-imports-guide/assets/asset-relationship-debugging) section of this book.
4. Continue with dryrun tests until you are happy that all the errors are accounted for.
5. Perform a live import against a single asset record (set `-dryrun=false`).
6. Review the imported asset record in Service Manage, and check all properties are as expected i.e. asset tag contains a valid asset tag etc.
7. Where necessary, adjust the configuration file asset property mappings
8. Loop through steps 5 - 7 as many times as is necessary until you are happy with the information being transported into the Service Manager asset record properties.
9. Amend the query to target the asset objects required for a full import.
10. Perform a dryrun
11. Review the commind line output and log file for any errors or warnings, and where necessary check and rectify any errors against Common Error Messages listed in the [Troubleshooting](/data-imports-guide/assets/asset-relationship-debugging) section of this book.
12. Continue with dryrun tests until you are happy that all the errors are accounted for.

## Command Line Examples

```cmd
asset_rel_import.exe -file="my_config.json" -dryrun=true
```
```powershell
asset_import.exe -file="my_config.json" -dryrun=true
```

## Resetting Encrypted Credentials
Should you wish to use a different Instance ID or API key to what has been previously encrypted, then simply delete the `import.cfg` file from the folder where the import binary resides. Once you re-run your import from the command line, the utility will again ask for the Instance ID and API Key details just as it would have on its first run.
