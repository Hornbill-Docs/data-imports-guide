# Scheduling an Import

## Windows
You can schedule asset_rel_import.exe to run with any optional command line argument from Windows Task Scheduler:

- Ensure the user account running the task has rights to asset_rel_import.exe and the containing folder.
- Make sure the Start In parameter contains the folder where asset_rel_import.exe resides in otherwise it will not be able to pick up the correct path.
